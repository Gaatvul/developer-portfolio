                I am a self-taught developer from Ireland, living in Germany. 
                With background in Automation Engineering and previous role in a FinTech company,
                my broad experience helps to inform my software development and gives me unique perspectives from which to view problems.
                When I'm not coding, I can usually be found in a rock climbing gym or tinkering with my 3D printer.</p>
